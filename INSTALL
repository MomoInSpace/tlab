In order to compile the code, run the following commands:

cd ${PATH_TO_TLAB}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DSYST={mpipc,juqueen,...} -DBUILD_TYPE={BIG,LITTLE,PARALLEL,NONBLOCKING}
make

Instead of mpipc or juqueen, you have to use the corresponding file from 
the directory ${PATH_TO_TLAB}/config

You need to have cmake installed: Try "module load cmake".

You can also run ./configure.sh, which would create the
different build_* directories automatically for your system.

To clean the tree, simply delete the directories build*

In order to check the code, run the following commands:

cd ${PATH_TO_DNS}
cd examples
make check BINS_PATH=${PATH_TO_EXECUTABLES_TO_BE_CHECKED}

(For instance, BINS_PATH=build_BIG)

After running make check, directories examples/Cases?? can be
cleaned running make clean (inside of directory examples)

Use valgrind to check for memory leaks.
