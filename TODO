* Variable ifilt_step in AVG_FLOW_SPATIAL_LAYER
* In some routines I do not need icalc_scal, icalc_flow, I can do the same with inb_scal=0
* Error control in libraries averages, pdfs...
* OMP/BLAS optimization to be implemented in THERMO routines
* Compressible cases have a bug with relaxation of BCs (SigmaInfJ and SigmaOut)
* In avg_scal_xz, add convective term and source Qss in transport eqn for Rss;
* ALLTOALL when kmax=1 and ims_npro_i>1 does not work and was commented out.
* Check the -qNOOVER in the intel compiler to force SIMD in pointers (NO OVERLAP MEMORY)
* Memory reqs. in two-point statistics to be reduced.
* Check random number generator in parallel mode; current decorrelation in rand_main.f90 might not be enough.
* OPR_INTERPOLATE does not work when the grid size changes both in the x,z directions and in the y direction.
* Update of filter routines for buffer and inflow need to be finished.
