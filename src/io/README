Restart files:
--------------
IEEE double precision floating point representation.
Sequential access mode
Unformatted records
Byte ordering is big-endian

Split mode: [default]
No record length information. First 4-bytes are an integer pointing to the 
field array after the header.

Array mode:
Embedded record information (4-bytes integer) for backwards compatibility,
 but should not be used because of new large-size files.
(header + flow fields) ...: header size is 96 bytes
(header + scalar fields) .: header size is 48 bytes

Arrays ordering:
----------------
inner-most index is streamwise
outer-most index is spanwise (domain decomposion in parallel MPI mode)
